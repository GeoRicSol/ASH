<h2>Planting and Bed Creation</h2>

<p>Creating a new garden bed is one of the most rewarding "blank canvas" projects you can take on. Whether you're looking to boost curb appeal or start a backyard veggie patch, the secret isn't just in the plants—it’s in the prep. We can help you create your dream.</p>

<p>Before you dig, observe your space for a few days. Plants are picky about their roommates and their environment.</p>
<p><b>Sun Exposure:</b> Track the light. "Full sun" means 6+ hours of direct sunlight. "Partial shade" is 3–6 hours.</p>
<p><b>Drainage:</b> After a rain, does the water pool or disappear? Most plants hate "wet feet" (root rot).</p>

<p><b>Bed Creation Methods:</b>Choosing the right method depends on how much time and effort you want to put into this project.</p>
<p><b>Digging (Traditional)</b> is a high effort solution. It allows for immediate planting; removing tough weeds/grass. Mechanical tools (Rotavators) can be use to break up, turn, and aerate soil. Rotavators are Ideally suited for large garden projects. </p>
<p><b>Sheet Mulching (No-Dig)</b> is a low effort solution. Itis a no-dig, organic technique used to convert lawns or weed-filled areas into fertile garden beds by layering materials like cardboard and compost. By layering organic matter, this method smothers existing plants, improves soil structure, retains moisture, and fosters biodiversity, effectively "composting in place" </p>
<p>While highly effective at creating new garden beds without tilling, it is not an instant solution, and the "long game" approach can lead to several, smaller, related drawbacks: 
Patience and Delayed Planting: Because the barrier (cardboard/newspaper) needs time to decompose, you cannot immediately plant in the area, often waiting for a full season or, at minimum, several months for it to become effective.</p>
<p><b>Raised Beds:</b> are a medium effort solution.It can be used where there is poor native soil; the beds are generally raised to approxiamately 25cm making it easier to work on for future gardening.
